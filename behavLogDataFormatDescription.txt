% lg is a flattened data structure where each field is either an array or a
% cell array of size 1 x num trials. Concatenated log files come from
% appending many different sessions from different mice, and there are
% fields to indicate which mouse and session (in number IDs) each trial
% belongs to. Please refer to Pinto, Koay et al, 2018, Frontiers in Behav
% Neurosci for details about trial selection
% Individual session logs follow the same general format, with detailed
% information about that session persent in lg.info, not present in
% concatenated logs
% Below is a list a brief description of all fields, for a log with ~149K
